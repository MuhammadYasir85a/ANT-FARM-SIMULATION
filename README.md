# ANT-FARM-SIMULATION
#TASK 02 
Description
The Ant Farm Simulation is a C++ program that models the behavior and management of ant colonies. Users can create and control multiple colonies, each with different types of ants (Drones, Warriors, and Queens) and rooms (Spawner and Relax rooms). The simulation operates in ticks, allowing ants to gather resources, rest, and engage in battles. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and design patterns in C++.

Features
Create and manage ant colonies.
Different ant types with unique behaviors.
Rooms for spawning and resting ants.
Tick-based simulation for dynamic interactions.
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the program and enter commands to interact with the simulation
